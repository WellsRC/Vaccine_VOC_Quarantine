%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Input
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% t - time post-infection
% u - time of testing
% R0S - Reproductive number symptomatic
% R0A - Reproductive number asymptomatic
% pA - proportion asymptomatic
% ts - time from infection to symptom onset (i.e. incubation period)
% tL - Duration of the latent period
% SelfIsolate - 0 no self-isolation of symptomatic otherwise self-isolation
% upon symptom onset

% Output
